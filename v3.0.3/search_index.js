Instead, with ifelse, the integrator does not know an event happens and thus must typically reduce its step size to handle the sudden change in models dynamics.

This is because the most efficient JumpProblem (Gillespie) simulators require mass action jumps, for more details see here. For how to check if a model follows mass action kinetics, see the FAQ in the documentation.\n\nnote: Note\nThe massaction keyword argument is only relevant for jump simulations. If you import the model as a SDEProblem or an ODEProblem, you can (and should) ignore this keyword argument.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\ncomplete::Bool=true: Whether or not to mark the returned Catalyst ReactionSystem as   complete. Only a complete system can be used for simulations, while only an incomplete   system can be composed with other systems. For more details, see the Catalyst.jl   documentation.\nifelse_to_callback::Bool=true: Rewrite ifelse (SBML piecewise) expressions to callbacks. This improves simulation runtime and stability. Strongly recomended to set to true.\ninline_assignment_rules::Bool=false: Inline SBML assignment rules into model equations.   Recommended for importing large models. However, if set to true, it is   not possible to access assignment rule variables via sol[:var].\ninline_kineticlaw_parameters::Bool=true: Inline (hardcode) SBML kinetic law parameter   values into the model equations. Kinetic law parameters are parameters defined only in   the kinetic law field of an SBML reaction. It is recommended to inline them as there   might be duplicate IDs, e.g., the same kinetic law parameter redefined for different   reactions. If they are not inlined, they are promoted to model parameters (with the   same status as parameters in the SBML file).\nwrite_to_file=false: Write the parsed SBML model to a Julia file in the same   directory as the SBML file.\nmodel_as_string::Bool=false: Whether the model (path) is provided as a string.\n\nReturns\n\nprn: A ParsedReactionNetwork that can be converted into a JumpProblem, a   SDEProblem, or an ODEProblem.
