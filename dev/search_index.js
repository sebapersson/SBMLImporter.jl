[{"location":"differences/#Other-SBML-related-Julia-packages","page":"Other SBML related Julia packages","title":"Other SBML related Julia packages","text":"There are currently three additional SBML related packages in Julia. SBML.jl wraps a subset of the libSBML functionality and is used by SBMLImporter and other SBML related packages for parsing SBML models. COBREXA.jl is designed for constraint-based metabolic modeling. Constraint-based models, which are often referred to as flux-balance analysis (FBA) models, are not supported by SBMLImporter.\n\nLastly, SBMLToolkit.jl similarly to SBMLImporter imports dynamic models into a ReactionSystem. However, we recommend SBMLImporter due to the following key differences:\n\nSBMLToolkit works with (and transforms) species to be in amount. SBMLImporter supports species units to be either amount or concentration.\nSBMLImporter has wider event support, including events with directionality. It further processes events without species in the trigger into a DiscreteCallback, making simulations more efficient.\nSBMLImporter rewrites SBML piecewise expressions to callbacks if possible instead of using ifelse, this improves simulation stability and reduces simulation runtime.\nWhen possible, SBMLImporter converts reactions to so-called MassActionJumps. This greatly improve performance for most Jump simulations.\nSBMLImporter has more extensive SBML support, passing more tests in the SBML test-suite. It is further the SBML importer for PEtab.jl, which regularly tests against several published models of various sizes.","category":"section"},{"location":"support/#support","page":"Supported SBML features","title":"Supported SBML Features","text":"SBMLImporter.jl supports a wide range of SBML features for models of level 2 or higher.

If you encounter installation issues on these systems, we recommend checking the following two common causes:\n\nan incorrectly installed or outdated Julia version,  \noutdated package dependencies.\n\nFirst, ensure that a supported Julia version is used. SBMLImporter is tested with Julia LTS version 1.10 and the latest stable version. Using an earlier version may result in installation failures. To reliably install and manage Julia versions across operating systems, we strongly recommend using juliaup. If you are constrained to using an older Julia version, for example on an HPC cluster, and encounter problems, please file an issue on GitHub.\n\nSecond, installation failures may result from outdated versions of SBMLImporter dependencies. For example, if SBMLImporter is installed into the global Julia environment, older versions of other packages may prevent the latest version from being installed. This can cause installation failures or break tutorials and example code. To avoid this, it is recommended to install SBMLImporter in a new, isolated environment. For example, to install it in an environment named sbmlimporter_project, run the following in the Julia REPL:\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.activate(\"sbmlimporter_project\")\nPkg.add(\"SBMLImporter\")\n# Add any additional packages as needed\n\nIf you need to install SBMLImporter into an existing environment and encounter issues, updating all packages may resolve the problem:\n\nPkg.update()\n\nThis is because SBMLImporter depends on numerous packages from the actively developing Julia SciML ecosystem. New releases of these dependencies sometimes introduce breaking changes that are not always caught by test suites (e.g., see this issue). In other words, SBMLImporter is not compatible with all versions of packages like Catalyst.jl, which can cause issues if an incompatible version is already installed in the environment.\n\nLastly, if you have tried everything above and still experience installation issues, it is likely a bug in SBMLImporter. In this case, please open an issue on GitHub.","category":"section"},{"location":"FAQ/#Why-do-I-get-the-error-Any[...]-are-either-missing-from-the-variable-map-or-missing-from-the-system's-states/parameters-list?","page":"FAQs","title":"Why do I get the error Any[...] are either missing from the variable map or missing from the system's states/parameters list?","text":"This error probably occurs because the model has an SBML assignment rule.

Firstly, the model might contain a function call where the argument must be positive, such as:\n\nlog(specie)\n\nEven though the model might be written such that specie should never go below 0 (e.g., the model follows mass action kinetics), numerical errors can cause specie to go below zero. Therefore, instead of encoding risky statements into the model such as log(specie), it might be better to encode something like log(specie + 1e-8).\n\nSecondly DomainError might arise due to how SBMLImporter parses SBML piecewise expressions. Piecewise expressions are first parsed into ifelse functions:\n\nifelse(condition, x, y)\n\nWhich when condition == true evaluates to x, otherwise to y. In SBMLImporter ifelse expressions are further rewritten to callbacks (events). Hence, in the model equations the ifelse is converted to:\n\n(1 - condition_bool) * x + condition_bool * y\n\nHere condition_bool is assigned via a callback (event) to be 1 when condition is true, and to 0 when condition if false. This has the same functionality as an ifelse, but is numerically more stable because the integrator (e.g., ODE solver) actually stops at points condition changes. Instead, with ifelse, the integrator does not know an event happens and thus must typically reduce its step size to handle the sudden change in models dynamics. This increases simulation time, and reduces simulation stability (e.g. ODE solvers fail more frequently). However, sometimes the formulas in the ifelse might depend on the condition. For example, let's say we have:\n\nifelse(t > 1, 0, log(t - 1))\n\nWith the ifelse formulation, log(t - 1) is never evaluated until t > 1. With the callback formulation:\n\n(1 - condition_bool) * 0 + condition_bool * log(t-1)\n\nlog(t-1) is evaluated for time-points t < 1 which causes DomainError. This can be solved by simply not rewriting ifelse to callback when importing the model:\n\nprn, cb = load_SBML(path; ifelse_to_callback = false)\n\nIf neither of the above solutions work, please file an issue on GitHub.","category":"section"},{"location":"FAQ/#Why-did-I-get-the-SBMLSupport-error?","page":"FAQs","title":"Why did I get the SBMLSupport error?","text":"You likely got this error because your SBML model contains an SBML feature that SBMLImporter does not support yet.
