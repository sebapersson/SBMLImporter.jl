SBMLImporter supports species units to be either amount or concentration.\nSBMLImporter has wider event support, including events with directionality. It further processes events without species in the trigger into a DiscreteCallback, making simulations more efficient.\nSBMLImporter rewrites SBML piecewise expressions to callbacks if possible instead of using ifelse, this improves simulation stability and reduces simulation runtime.\nWhen possible, SBMLImporter converts reactions to so-called MassActionJumps. This greatly improve performance for most Jump simulations.\nSBMLImporter has more extensive SBML support, passing more tests in the SBML test-suite.

Instead, with ifelse, the integrator does not know an event happens and thus must typically reduce its step size to handle the sudden change in models dynamics.
