Constraint-based models, which are often referred to as flux-balance analysis (FBA) models, are not supported by SBMLImporter.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/SBMLToolkit.jl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SBMLToolkit.jl</a> similarly to SBMLImporter imports dynamic models into a <code>ReactionSystem</code>. However, we recommend SBMLImporter due to the following key differences:</p><ul><li><p>SBMLToolkit works with (and transforms) species to be in amount. SBMLImporter supports species units to be either amount or concentration.</p></li><li><p>SBMLImporter has wider event support, including events with directionality. It further processes events without species in the trigger into a <code>DiscreteCallback</code>, making simulations more efficient.</p></li><li><p>SBMLImporter rewrites SBML piecewise expressions to callbacks if possible instead of using <code>ifelse</code>, this improves simulation stability and reduces simulation runtime.</p></li><li><p>When possible, SBMLImporter converts reactions to so-called <code>MassActionJump</code>s. This greatly improve performance for most Jump simulations.</p></li><li><p>SBMLImporter has more extensive SBML support, passing more tests in the SBML test-suite. It is further the SBML importer for PEtab.jl, which regularly tests against several published models of various sizes.</p></li></ul>',4)])])}const f=t(i,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
